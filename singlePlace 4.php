Unawatuna has a diverse ecosystem. The marsh land or mangrove, Kadolana, which was partially dredged and filled to create a hotel for a German hotel chain, was its biggest potential ecotourism draw. The plan never came to fruition. Many residents say it was cursed since it was er ected so close to the Wella Devalaya.Clive Byers, an ornithologist, has spotted over sixty species of indigenous birds in the area, including terns, egrets, herons, sandpipers, and kingfishers, as well as rarer species such the smaller whistling duck, Asian palm swift, white breasted waterhen, Loten's sunbird, and black bittern. The remnant marshy region and Rumass ala Hillock are the best places to see these birds. .</span>
