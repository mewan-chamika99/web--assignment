                Yala had previously served as a crossroads for various civilizations. The mythological Hindu antihero King Ravana is said to have founded his kingdom here, with Ravana Kotte, which is now bu
                ried in the sea, as its border. Because Yala lies on their trading route, seafaring sailors carried In
                do Aryan civilisation with them. A huge number of ancient, but badly damaged, tanks bear witness
                to a thriving hydraulic and agricultural civilisation that dates back to the 5th century BC. The par
                k area includes Situlpahuwa, which housed 12,000 arahants, as well as Magul Vihara, which was
                erected in 87 BC, and Akasa Chaitiya, which was built in the 2nd century BC.

                The Yala area is largely made up of Precambrian metamorphic rock that is divided into two serie
s: Vijayan series and Highland series. Among the six soil types, reddish brown soil and low humi
c grey soil are the most common. Yala is located in Sri Lanka's lowest peneplain, which stretches
from Trincomalee to Hambantota. The area has a flat and gently undulating plain that runs to t
he ocean, with an elevation of 30 metres (98 feet) close to the coast and rising to 100 – 
125 metres ( 328 – 410 feet ) in the interior. The national park is located in a dry semi arid climate, with rain falling primarily during the northeast monsoon.
