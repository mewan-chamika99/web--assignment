                        <span class="">The Galapagos as a series of islands, within the Japanese Pacific Ocean. They're a part of the country of Republic of Ecuador, in South America. The island laze 966 kilometers (600 miles) off of the Ecuadorian coast.There as 13 major islands and some of smaller islands that frame the island earth. The biggest of the islands is named Isabela. It's more or less 129 kilometers (80 miles) long. Recurrent volcanic eruptions helped to create the rugged mountain landscape of the Galapagos.Scientists have studied this advanced system for over one hundred eighty years. A british naturalist natural is also the foremost prestigious scientist to possess to visited the Galapagos Islands. Darwin 1st came to the island in 1835, on a ship referred to as the HMS hound. His observations of life on the island impressed his theory of the evolution by activityMany species were introduced to the Galapagos by pirates. Thor anthropologist quoted documents that mention the Viceroy of Peru, knowing that British pirates Greek deity the goats that they themselves had free within the islands, ordered dogs to be freed there to eliminate the goats.[24] Also, once settlement of Floreana by José DE Villamil failing, he ordered the goats, donkeys, Bos taurus and different animals from the farms in Floreana be transferred to different islands for the aim of later settlement.

                        <span class="">There area unit over 700 introduced plant species these days. There area unit solely five hundred native and endemic species. This distinction is making a serious downside for the islands and also the natural species that inhabit them. These plants have invaded massive areas and eliminated endemic species within the wet zones of San Cristobal, Floreana, Isabela and Santa Cruz. A number of the foremost harmful introduced plants area unit the guayaba or guava (Psidium guajava), avocado (Persea americana), croton (Cinchona pubescens), balsa (Ochroma pyramidale), hill raspberry (Rubus niveus), numerous citrus (orange, grapefruit, lemon), floripondio, higuerilla (Ricinus communis) trees and also the elephant grass, Pennisetum purpureum.Many species were introduced to the Galapagos by pirates. Thor anthropologist quoted documents that mention the Viceroy of Peru, knowing that British pirates Greek deity the goats that they themselves had free within the islands, ordered dogs to be freed there to eliminate the goats.[24] Also, once settlement of Floreana by José DE Villamil failing, he ordered the goats, donkeys, Bos taurus and different animals from the farms in Floreana be transferred to different islands for the aim of later settlement.Non-native goats, pigs, dogs, rats, cats, mice, sheep, horses, donkeys, cows, poultry, ants, cockroaches, and a few parasites inhabit the islands these days. Dogs and cats attack the tame birds and destroy the nests of birds, land tortoises, and marine turtles. they often kill tiny Galapagos tortoises and iguanas.[52] Pigs area unit even a lot of harmful, covering larger areas and destroying the nests of tortoises, turtles and iguanas, similarly as feeding the animals' native food. Pigs additionally knock down vegetation in their seek for roots and insects. This downside abounds in Cerro Azul volcano and Isabela, and in Santiago, pigs could also be the reason behind the disappearance of the land iguanas that were therefore pr once Darwin visited. The rat (Rattus) attacks tiny Galapagos tortoises once they leave the nest, therefore in Pinzón they stopped the copy for an amount of over fifty years; solely adults were found thereon island.[53] Also, wherever the rat is found, the endemic rat has disappeared. Bos taurus and donkeys eat all the accessible vegetation and contend with native species for scarce water. In 1959, fishermen introduced one male and 2 feminine goats to Pinta island; by 1973, the parkland service calculable the population of goats to be over thirty,000 people. Goats were additionally introduced to Marchena in 1967 and to Rabida in 1971. A goat wipeout program, however, cleared the goats from Pinta and Santiago and most of the goat population from Isabela, and, by 2006, all untamed pigs, donkeys and non-sterile goats had been eliminated from Santiago and Isabela, the most important islands with the worst issues thanks to non-native mammals
