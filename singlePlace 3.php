The Ohiya Railway Station is the third highest in the country at a height of 5820 ft above the sea level.
The climate is humid, and rainfall is almost throughout the year. However, the months from January to March is considered a favoured time to visit the place as those are the drier months within the region.

The second and third highest peaks in Sri Lanka, Kirigalpoththa (2,389 meters (7,838 feet) and Thotupola Kanda (2,357 meters (7,733 feet), are located to the west and north, respectively. The elevation of the park varies between 1,200 and 2,300 meters (3,900 and 7,500 feet). Khondalites, Charnockites, and granitic gneisses make up the rocks found in the park, which date back to the Archaean period and belong to the Precambrian era's high series. The soil is of the red-yellow podsolic group, with decomposed organic debris covering the surface layer. .</span>

At the latest, the Sri Lankan elephant vanished from the region in the 1940s. The sambar deer is currently the largest and most regularly seen mammal. According to some research, the sambar deer population is estimated to be between 1500 and 2000, probably exceeding the plains' carrying capacity.</span>
