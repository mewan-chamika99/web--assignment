    tradition is held to be the footprint of the BuddhaThe hike includes 5,000-6,000 crumbling steps and incline trekking, but technical climbing is not required. Depending on the trail taken, the crowd and the climbers' 
             fitness level, the mountain can take approximately two to four hours to climb and one to two hours to descend.

It refers to a footprint shaped mark on the summit that Buddhists believe is that of the Buddha. According to Christian and Islamic legends, it is Adam's imprint that was left when he first set foot on Earth after bein g expelled out of paradise, hence the name "Adam's Peak." The footprint is thought to be that of the Hindu god Shiva, and the peak is named Shiva padam ( Shiva's foot) in Tamil. The mountain is also known as Shivanolipatha Malai among Tamils.</span>

The Nallathanni and Palabaddala routes are the most popular among climbers, whereas the Kur uwita Erathna track is less frequently used. These paths are popular because they are connected by b us to large cities or towns. The Murraywatte, Mookuwatte, and Malimboda trails are rarely utilized, however they do cross the Palabaddala road about halfway up the slope. The most common pilgrim path is to ascend via Hatton and descend via Ratnapura. Although the Hatton trail is the steepest, it is also the sh ortest by almost five kilometers of any of the other trails.</span>
