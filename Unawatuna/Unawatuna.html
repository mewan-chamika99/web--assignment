                Unawatuna has a diverse ecosystem.
                The marsh land or mangrove, Kadolana, which was partially dredged and filled to create a hotel
                for a German hotel chain, was its biggest potential ecotourism draw. The plan never came to fruition. Many residents say it was cursed since it was er
                ected so close to the Wella Devalaya.Clive Byers, an ornithologist, has spotted over sixty species
                of indigenous birds in the area, including terns, egrets, herons, sandpipers, and kingfishers, as
                well as rarer species such the smaller whistling duck, Asian palm swift, white breasted waterhen, Loten's sunbird, and black bittern. The remnant marshy region and Rumass
                ala Hillock are the best places to see these birds.
