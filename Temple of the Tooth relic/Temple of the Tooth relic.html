                <p>Built in the year 1595 during the reign of King Vimaladarmasuriya I, the temple houses the sacred tooth relic of Lord Buddha and therefore is venerated by devotees of the Buddhist faith from all corners of the world. It is a place of great historic, cultural and spiritual significance, a place to visit but also experience. And the gorgeous Sri Lankan wildlife is never far away! The Kalinga king Guhasiva in the 4th century AD sends the tooth relic to Sri Lanka with Prince Danta and Princess Hemamala in order to prevent its possession by his enemies who made war. The tooth relic is received by the then King Meghavanna in Anuradhapura and enshrined in a 3rd century holy edifice.

                The water waves wall is a brick wall that goes along the moat and the Bogambara lake.
                This wall has holes in it that are used to light coconut oil lamps. Mahawahalkada is the name of
                the main entrance gate, which is located above the moat. A Sandakada pahana (moonstone) ca
                rved in Kandyan architectural style may be found at the foot of the Mahawahalkada steps. Mah
                awahalkada, along with Sandakada pahana and other stone carvings, was completely destroyed
                in a bomb blast in 1998 and reconstructed subsequently. On either side of the entrance, stone
                elephants are depicted.

                According to mythology, after Gautama Buddha's Mahaparinirvana, Princess Hemamali and her
                husband, Prince Dantha, kept the tooth relic in Kalinga and transported it to the island on the or
                ders of her father, King Guhasiva. On the way to the island, Hemmamali hid the relic in her hair.
                During the reign of Sirimeghavanna of Anuradhapura (301-
                328), they landed on the island of Lankapattana and gave over the tooth relic. The king enshrine
                d it at Anuradhapura's Meghagiri Vihara (modern-day Isurumuniya).</div>
