          "The origin of the word "travel" is most likely lost to history. The term "travel" may originate from the Old French word travail, which
           means 'work'. According to the Merriam Webster dictionary, the first known use of the word travel was in the 14th century. It also states
          that the word comes from Middle English travailen, travelen (which means to torment, labor, strive, journey) and earlier from Old French 
          travailler (which means to work strenuously, toil)."
