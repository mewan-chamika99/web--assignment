Bingham had been seeking Vilcabamba (Vilcapampa), the “lost town of the Incas,” from that the last Inca rulers diode a rebellion against Spanish rule till 1572. He cited proof from his 1912 excavations at Machu Picchu, that were sponsored by Yale University and also the National Geographic Society, in his labeling of the positioning as Vilcabamba; but, that interpretation isn't any longer wide accepted.
