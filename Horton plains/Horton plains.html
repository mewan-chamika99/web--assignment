                Horton Plains is situated on the southern plateau of Sri Lanka's central highlands. The second and third highest peaks in Sri Lanka, Kirigalpoththa (2,389 meters (7,838 feet) and Thotupola Kanda (2,357 meters (7,733 feet), are located to the west and north, respectively. The elevation of the park varies between 1,200 and 2,300 meters (3,900 and 7,500 feet). Khondalites, Charnockites, and granitic gneisses make up the rocks found in the park, which date back to the Archaean period and belong to the Precambrian era's high series. The soil is of the red-yellow podsolic group, with decomposed organic debris covering the surface layer.

                The region's vertebrate fauna comprises 24 mammalian species, 87 bird species, nine reptile species, and eight amphibian species. At the latest, the Sri Lankan elephant vanished from the region in the 1940s. The sambar deer is currently the largest and most regularly seen mammal. According to some research, the sambar deer population is estimated to be between 1500 and 2000, probably exceeding the plains' carrying capacity.</div>
