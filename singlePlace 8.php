It's far domestic to glaciers, alpine levels and specific flowers and fauna that has been in existence considering the fact that New Zealand turned into a part of the supercontinent Gondwanaland. Fiordland National Park is located on the south-west corner of the South Island of New Zealand.</span>

An awful lot later, european sealers and whalers took refuge in the fiords and built a handful of small settlements, those being New Zealand’s earliest eu settlements. However normal the sheer steepness of the terrain, the high-quality isolation, and the wettest climate in New Zealand deterred all but the hardiest from settling in the area</span>

Here, the beauty of the area is shaped by water - lakes, rivers, streams, waterfalls, lush rainforest, stunning fiords and water locked up as glaciers. The secret to enjoying your time here is to be prepared for Fiordland weather and be prepared for rain - at any time of the year. Of course you may strike a drought - two days or more without rain! Bring layers for clothing, sensible footwear and of course, a good raincoat.</span>
