Thousands of travelers head to Meteora per year, to travel to the six lovely monasteries sitting on the best of the rocks. From the twenty-five in total monasteries created inside the Byzantine times, only six space units were still operational and space units hospitable to the public. However, ancient monasteries are not the only real reason why tourists flock to Meteora. Many travelers in addition visit Meteora for hiking and rising, a pair of the foremost common things to undertake in Meteora. As for the landscape, it is, of course, sensible for nature exploration.</span>
